A realistic close-up of a television screen displaying CNN U.S. election results. The broadcast layout shows the two candidates with their photos: P Diddy at 50.2% and Jeffry Epstein at 49.8%. Their portraits appear beside their names and percentages in a clean red-and-blue election graphic. On the right side of the screen, a female news anchor is visible in a small live window, as if she is reporting the results. High-resolution, realistic lighting, slight screen glare, modern American news broadcast style.
