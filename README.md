## 🎨 What is Nano‑Banana-Pro

Nano‑Banana-Pro is a multimodal model that not only turns text prompts into high‑quality images but also offers image‑to‑image editing—enabling targeted retouching, style transfer, and multi‑image blending.

- 🧠 Multimodal comprehension: Simultaneously parses text and images to capture creative intent with precision
- ✍️ Accurate rendering: Handles complex prompts and rapidly produces high‑quality images
- 🎨 Diverse styles: Ghibli, painterly, pixel art, 3D plush, and more—pick your favorite
- 🖼️ Realistic composition: Spatial depth, perspective, and lighting that feel authentic
- ✏️ Easy post‑editing: Swap backgrounds, tweak details—seamless for second‑round creation
- ⚡️ Lightning‑fast interaction: Shorter response times for real‑time ideation and iteration

**Prompt**

```
an animated illustration of a party of five adventurers navigating a cave system. In the middle, the tall, old guide stands. He is dressed in navy blue wizard robes. He has a silver goatee and a wise smile on his face. He holds a brown walking stick. He is carrying a heavy load of packs. A grimoire floats next to him, creating a luminescent light to guide the way. On his right, stands the towering Berserker. The berserker is wearing fur armor. He has a sculpted, muscular and tall build. His muscles are covered in storm lightning runes that flicker and crack. He is carrying twin axes, one in his left hand, and another in his axe holster on his hip. He has a large bastardsword on his back. He is gnawing on a huge piece of meat which he holds with his right hand. On the right of the berserker stands the pretty, fair-skinned healer. She is short and cute, wearing pure white priestess robes with golden trim. She has blonde hair and she is actually levitating a bit off the ground, with an aura around her. On the left of the guide stands a mischievious, redhead archer with a crafty smile on her face. She is drawing her bow. She has a number of arrows on her back and bombs strapped to her leather armor. She is slender and of average height. Next to her left stands the bald monk with five shaolin marks on his head. He wears orange monk robes and has a lean-muscular build. He is wearing sandals. He is carrying daoist builds and holding his hands close together in prayer.

**Prompt**

```
画幅比例16:9，一张大师级的电影感过肩镜头画面，视角位于一个怀旧的90年代中国家庭成员身后。这个视角将观众直接带入场景中，与角色一同望向电视。

场景与视角:
前景是父亲和小孩头部的柔焦剪影，这确立了观众的观察视角。我们正越过他们看向前方。电视周围的房间沐浴在温暖、朦胧的黄色调灯光中，带有王家卫电影般的可见胶片颗粒感。老式风扇、花纹热水瓶等细节可见，但不是主要焦点。

电视机 (视觉焦点):
镜头的中心焦点是一台老式的、厚重的、有木纹外壳的显像管电视机，它正**面对着家人（即背对镜头）**。

屏幕内容 (关键对比):
**与柔焦的前景和充满颗粒感的房间形成强烈对比**，电视屏幕上的图像**是不可思议地锐利、鲜艳和清晰**。它是在一个模拟信号世界中打开的一扇完美的8K超高清窗口。屏幕内容**绝对不能有任何反光、扫描线或球面畸变**。

屏幕上的文字 (最高优先级, 刀锋般锐利):
电视屏幕上正播放着“Nano Banana 2”的未来感广告。屏幕上的文字是**整个图像中最锐利的元素，必须完美清晰可读**。字体采用大胆、时髦的90年代“美术字”风格。
- **第一行 (大而醒目):** 「未来之约，准时抵达！」
- **第二行 (在下方清晰可见):** 「2025年11月18日」
务必确保这些汉字和数字**形态完美、如刀锋般锐利，没有任何模糊或变形**。

美学:
一幅关于视角和对比的杰作。过肩镜头创造了一种亲密、窥视的感觉，让观众成为这个时间瞬间的一部分。朦胧的、模拟信号的过去（房间和人）与来自未来的完美、超高清清晰文字之间的超现实并置，构成了整个画面的核心叙事。

负面提示词:
家人的正面视角, 角色面向镜头, 电视面向镜头, 模糊的文字, 无法辨认的文字, 文字错误, 屏幕反光, 扫描线, 像素化的屏幕, 扭曲的屏幕内容, 现代房间, 平板电视, 水印。

**Prompt**

```
画幅比例16:9，一张迷人而精致的成都手绘旅游地图，具有吉卜力工作室艺术设定集般的风格。整个画面是在一张有纹理的、陈旧的羊皮纸上的水彩和钢笔淡彩插画。整体美学风格异想天开、充满活力和生活气息。

地图布局与风格:
地图以风格化的等轴测视角，展示了成都的核心地标，这些地标被描绘成可爱、精细的微缩建筑和图标（例如，熊猫基地的熊猫、锦里的灯笼、人民公园的茶馆）。布局是有机的、自由流动的，而非基于僵硬的网格。

至关重要的字体排版挑战 (高难度部分):
所有文字必须以一种优美的、略带不完美感的手写书法风格（行楷）呈现，看起来就像是用绘制插图的同一支钢笔写出来的。
1.  **主标题:** 主标题“成都慢行图”被艺术性地写在顶部一条飘逸的缎带上。
2.  **带角度的趣味标签:** 每个地标图标旁边，都以俏皮的、略带倾斜的方式写着它的名字（例如：“宽窄巷子”、“武侯祠”、“杜甫草堂”）。文字需要感觉是有机放置的，而不是死板的水平线。
3.  **沿路径弯曲的文字:** 一条风格化的锦江贯穿地图。河流的名字“锦江”二字，需要沿着河流的弯曲路径优雅地书写。这是一个关键测试点。
4.  **融合性的注释:** 地图上散布着小小的、异想天开的注释，这些注释结合了文字和图标。例如：
    - 一条写着“吃火锅!”的注释，旁边画着一个小小的红辣椒。
    - 一个“喝茶咯!”的标签，旁边有一个冒着热气的微型茶杯图标。
    - 区域名称“锦江区”被写在一个手绘的云朵形状里。
5.  **手绘图例:** 在一个角落，有一个手绘的“图例”方框，里面有小图标（如茶杯、熊猫脸、寺庙屋顶）和它们对应的手写标签。
6.  **印章:** 一枚红色的、仿佛手工篆刻风格的印章，印着“蓉”字（成都的简称），被盖在角落，并与边框有轻微的重叠。

美学:
一幅插画地图学的杰作。文字和插图的融合必须天衣无缝。水彩效果要柔和，有可见的水渍和纹理，而钢笔线条则要自信而生动。整体感觉温暖、诱人，充满个性。

负面提示词:
电脑字体, 计算机生成的文字, 直线, 僵硬的网格, 完美对齐, 只有水平文字, 文字浮层, 照片, 3D, 极简, 通用图标, 拼写错误, 乱码, 水印。

**Prompt**

```
画幅比例16:9，一幅令人叹为观止的插画地图学杰作，描绘了唐代首都长安的地图。整个画面以唐代仕女画的精致风格呈现，令人联想到绘画大师周昉的作品。媒材是在陈旧、细腻的绢本上使用工笔重彩。

**构图与透视:**
地图采用“散点透视”的长卷形式。城市感觉更像一幅生动的织锦，而非僵硬的蓝图。朱雀大街作为画面的中轴线。

**插画与字体细节:**
- **作为微型场景的地标:** 关键地点是小巧、精致的叙事场景：
    - **大明宫:** 宫廷仕女在园林中演奏乐器。
    - **西市:** 粟特商人与贵族妇女交易丝绸。
    - **曲江池:** 仕女们正在进行“曲水流觞”。
- **作为地图元素的优雅人物:** 优雅的唐代仕女被用作装饰元素，她们的姿态和袖带引导着观众的视线。

**一百零八坊 - 高级指令:**
一百零八坊由一个个优雅的手绘长方形印章来代表。核心目标是用貌似可信的、具有历史感的文字填充这些印章。
- **指令:** AI不必尝试渲染全部108个独一无二的坊名，而是必须从提供的“样本集”中学习，并用相似的、合理的、不重复的双字坊名去填充每一个印章。
- **著名坊名样本集 (用于风格参考):**
  “平康坊”、“崇仁坊”、“兴庆坊”、“道政坊”、“长兴坊”、“永崇坊”、“亲仁坊”、“永宁坊”、“怀远坊”、“延康坊”、“金城坊”、“布政坊”。
- **风格强制要求:** 所有印章内的文字必须是优美、纤细、典雅的“小篆”字体。结构应为“[某][某]坊”。

**主标题与标签:**
- **主标题:** “大唐长安”以雄浑大气的隶书，竖排书写在右上角。
- **标签:** 街道（“朱雀大街”）和河流（“渭水”）的名称，以娟秀的行书直接写在绢本背景上，并顺着路径的曲线流动。

**美学与氛围:**
调色板丰富而华丽（朱砂、石绿、石青、金箔）。线条如“游丝描”般细劲流畅。整体氛围是一种繁华、诗意、优雅的感觉。

**负面提示词:**
英文, 罗马字母, 3D, 现代地图, 网格布局, 几何形状, 电脑字体, 西方艺术风格, 卡通, 简单, 极简, 空白区域, 水印, 糟糕的书法, 乱码。

**Prompt**

```
画幅比例16:9，一幅关于精妙含蓄与视觉智慧的杰作。一幅老北京城市肌理的无人机鸟瞰图。核心概念是汉字“衚”**完美无缝地**融入了整个城市景观。

**字体与建筑的融合 (终极的精妙之处):**
- **无物理高差:** “衚”字不是一个独立的、高耸的或庞大的结构。构成其笔画的墙体，与周围所有的胡同、四合院的墙体，在**高度、材质和风格上完全一致**。它身处肌理之中，而非凌驾其上。
- **“光影雕刻”:** 汉字的形态并非由结构来凸显，而是由**大师级的、富有氛围感的光影**来呈现。一束低角度的午后斜阳（Raking Light）横扫整个场景。光线刚好捕捉到构成“衚”字形态的墙体的边缘，使其微妙地变亮，同时在其“笔画”（即胡同）内部投下深刻而轮廓分明的阴影。这个字，是被光所揭示，而非被水泥所建造。
- **“氛围透视”:** 一层纤薄的、贴地的晨雾或霭气，弥漫在周边的庭院和巷陌中，使边缘的细节略微柔化。然而，构成“衚”字形态的那些路径和庭院，则**微妙地更加清晰、对比度更高**，由此形成一个自然的视觉焦点，让隐藏的形状在凝视者的眼中浮现。

**优雅的字体排版布局:**
保留精致且艺术化的字体设计。
- **主标题:** 标题“字里京城”被排成一个强有力的单列竖排，位于右侧。背景区域被巧妙地处理成半透明的微妙褪色效果，以确保文字的可读性而不突兀。字体是优雅的“新宋体”风格。一条极细的竖线与文字平行。
- **信息标签:** 标签文字（“灰瓦”、“国槐”）采用小号、精致的手写体。它们通过一条铅笔在图纸上画出般的、针尖般纤细的手绘曲线连接到物体。**不要有方框，不要有发光效果。**

**美学:**
整体基调是宁静、引人深思且意境深远的。色调是考究的“高级灰”，以饱和度低的色彩为主，唯一的色彩点缀来自阳光温暖的轻抚。画面拥有一种“众目睽睽下的秘密”般的气质，回报着观者的耐心与洞察力。它是一次具有深刻绘画感和哲学氛围的超写实渲染。

**负面提示词:**
高耸的墙壁, 雕塑般的汉字, 庞大的结构, 过于明显的汉字形状, 平均的光照, 平光, 发光方框, 未来感UI, 无衬线字体, 抽象, 2D, 色彩鲜艳, 卡通, 糟糕的书法, 水印。

### No. 44: 过肩镜头：雨夜瘦金体书稿

<p>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Physics-3b82f6?style=flat-square" alt="Physics">
</p>

<img src="cases/44/case.webp" width="300" alt="文人右手执笔书写《声声慢》，孤灯映照宣纸；雨滴在新字上炸裂成纤细羽毛状洇染，与窗外芭蕉雨景相映。"><br>

**Prompt**

```
画幅比例16:9，一个源自中国古装剧的、极富氛围感和叙事性的电影镜头，散发着宋代典雅、克制的美学。风格令人联想到张艺谋的电影。

**构图与视角:**
一个精心构图的**过肩镜头**。摄影机位于一位文人身后，越过他的肩膀，望向半开的窗外雨景。

**叙事元素与调度:**
- **窗外景象:** 透过雕花木窗，一株巨大的芭蕉树正被大雨抽打。
- **人物与动作:** 文人坐在书案前，**右手**以正确的姿势执笔。他的左手按在纸张边缘。
- **书稿 (极致的细节与神韵):** 桌上的宣纸是清晰的视觉焦点，被一盏温暖的孤灯照亮。
    - **书法:** 纸上写满了**笔画锐利的“瘦金体”**，内容是李清照的《声声慢》开篇。
    - **墨色变化 (墨分五色):** 字迹的墨色应有微妙而真实的变化。较早写下、已经干透的字是深沉的、哑光的“焦墨”。最新写的字则是更浓郁、湿润、闪着光泽的“湿墨”。
    - **墨迹晕染效果 (诗意的高潮):** 几滴雨点落在了纸上。
        - 在**较干的旧字**上，雨滴只留下一个微妙的、半透明的水痕，字迹本身保持清晰。
        - 在**湿润的新字**上，雨滴导致墨迹**向外“炸”开，形成一圈精细的、羽毛状的洇染**。晕染的边缘不是一个实心圆，而是有机的、**带有纤维感的“毛边”**，仿佛墨水正顺着宣纸的纹理漫开。这个效果必须既美丽又充满悲剧感。

**光影与色调:**
一盏孤灯的暖光至关重要。它必须捕捉到新洇开墨迹的湿润光泽，突显出那圈墨花富有质感的纤维边缘，并在纸张干燥的部分投下柔和的光泽。这温暖的室内与窗外冷色调、低饱和度的绿和灰形成对比。

**美学:**
一幅在电影镜头中捕捉到中国水墨画灵魂的杰作。对墨、水、纸之间物理互动的关注，将这个场景从一个简单的叙事提升为对“无常”和“秩序世界被混乱入侵”的深刻冥想。

**负面提示词:**
墨色完全一样, 实心的墨团晕染, 完全干燥的纸, 左手写字, 不正确的姿势, 模糊的文字, 现代字体, 粗壮的笔画, 晴天, 微笑, 水印。

**Prompt**

```
A powerful, high-contrast black-and-white side-profile portrait of a person (use reference photo,  Keep face of person 100% accurate from the reference image), with distinctly human yet timeless features emerging from complete darkness.

The composition is minimalist and sculptural, where form, light, and shadow define the subject rather than color or texture.

(Subject is the person in the attached reference image)

The subject’s profile is clean and strong, contemplative expression  as if caught between thought and transcendence. They wear a dark, form-fitting turtleneck sweater that merges seamlessly into the black void, erasing all detail except the glowing edge of their silhouette.

A single, narrow rim light  bright, sharp, and directional  carves out the shape of the head, neck, and shoulder, tracing the contours with precision. The light originates from directly behind and slightly above the subject, creating a thin, luminous halo along the jawline and curve of the skull, while the rest dissolves into pure black.

The background is absolute darkness, a void without texture or depth, emphasizing the luminous boundary between shadow and light.

There are no midtones, only the purest black and deliberate contrast with the brightest whites  heightening drama and abstraction.

Mood & Aesthetic: Minimalist, conceptual, and deeply introspective. Evokes solitude, contemplation, and timeless elegance. Feels cinematic yet intimate  an exploration of identity through light.

Technical details:

Shot with a telephoto lens for compressed perspective

Aperture: wide open (f/1.8–2.8) to achieve glowing contour and shallow depth of field

Lighting: front face with good highlight balance

Rendering: ultra-realistic 8K cinematic quality, true lens physics, depth of field, subtle film grain

**Prompt**

```
A hyper-realistic cinematic portrait of the person from the uploaded reference image (keep the face 100% accurate with the same expression, skin tone, and proportions). The person is kneeling in a harsh desert environment under a clear blue sky. Their body is covered in dry dust and sand, with worn tribal-style clothing made of torn fabric, rope, and rugged layers that look sun-beaten and weathered. Braided hair with loose strands falls around the face, and bold dark-blue war paint streaks run across the eyes and forehead.

Two lions sit behind the person — one adult male with a thick golden mane and one young lion cub. Both lions look straight into the camera with calm but alert expressions. Their fur has warm sandy tones that match the desert light. Soft shadows form under their bodies on the dry cracked ground.

A large bleached animal skull lies in the foreground, slightly out of focus, creating a strong depth-of-field effect. The skull has rough textures, cracks, and sand collected in the cavities. Sunlight creates crisp highlights on the edges and soft diffused shadows inside the hollow areas.

Lighting is bright and natural, coming from the high midday sun, casting short shadows. The overall color tone is warm, earthy, and dusty. The camera angle is low, close to the skull, with the focus on the person and lions while the foreground remains blurred. Background is a simple clear sky with no clouds, giving a stark open-desert feeling.

Image style: ultra-realistic, high detail, documentary style, sharp textures, natural shadows, cinematic depth, 8k quality."

**Prompt**

```
A powerful, high-contrast black-and-white side-profile portrait of a person (use reference photo,  Keep face of person 100% accurate from the reference image), with distinctly human yet timeless features emerging from complete darkness.

(Subject is the person in the attached reference image)

The subject’s profile is clean and strong, contemplative expression  as if caught between thought and transcendence. They wear a dark, form-fitting turtleneck sweater that merges seamlessly into the black void, erasing all detail except the glowing edge of their silhouette.

A single, narrow rim light  bright, sharp, and directional  carves out the shape of the head, neck, and shoulder, tracing the contours with precision. The light originates from directly behind and slightly above the subject, creating a thin, luminous halo along the jawline and curve of the skull, while the rest dissolves into pure black.

The background is absolute darkness, a void without texture or depth, emphasizing the luminous boundary between shadow and light.

There are no midtones, only the purest black and deliberate contrast with the brightest whites  heightening drama and abstraction.

Mood & Aesthetic: Minimalist, conceptual, and deeply introspective. Evokes solitude, contemplation, and timeless elegance. Feels cinematic yet intimate  an exploration of identity through light.

Technical details:

Shot with a telephoto lens for compressed perspective

Aperture: wide open (f/1.8–2.8) to achieve glowing contour and shallow depth of field

Lighting: front face with good highlight balance

Rendering: ultra-realistic 8K cinematic quality, true lens physics, depth of field, subtle film grain

**Prompt**

```
Create an ultra-realistic portrait of the uploaded person standing indoors beside a giant Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey bottle prop. The person should keep their exact face, hairstyle, skin tone, and body shape from the uploaded photo. They wear a black suit, white shirt, no tie, and black shoes. They hold a glass of whiskey in one hand while resting the other arm on the oversized whiskey bottle.

Show a premium wooden bar interior in the background, with dark brown shelves filled with neatly arranged liquor bottles of different shapes, colors, and labels. Add warm ambient lighting from small ceiling spotlights that create soft highlights on the bottle shelves. Use a clean marble countertop edge behind them.

The giant Jack Daniel’s bottle must look highly realistic: transparent glass with warm amber whiskey inside, clear reflections, crisp highlights, and accurate bottle contours. The front label should follow the Jack Daniel’s style (white text on black background), but avoid exact real-world text; use stylized placeholder lettering similar in style. Make the bottle much taller than the person’s waist and almost reach shoulder height.

Use a clean full-body framing, straight-on camera angle at eye level, with natural depth of field so the person and bottle are in sharp focus while the background has slight soft blur. Maintain even, warm-toned lighting with gentle shadows under the person’s shoes and subtle reflections on the polished floor. The mood should feel classy, calm, and premium, like a professional event photo.

Keep the final output photorealistic with clear skin texture, crisp suit fabric details, realistic glass reflections, and accurate color balance.
