  Create A soft, sunlit portrait wearing a flowing sheer yellow saree with delicate floral embroidery. Sit gracefully against a plain wall, bathed in warm natural light with a triangular patch of sunlight casting artistic shadows. Hold a vibrant bouquet of sunflowers close to the chest, and a small white flower is tucked behind he ear. Gentle expression, loose hair strands moving slightly, and the dreamy golden glow create a serene, poetic, and romantic.
