  Making a playful peace sign with both hands and winking. Tearful eyes and slightly trembling lips, showing a cute crying expression. Arms wide open in a warm, enthusiastic hug pose. Lying on their side asleep, resting on a tiny pillow with a sweet smile. Pointing forward with confidence, surrounded by shining visual effects. Blowing a kiss, with heart symbols floating around. Maintain the chibi aesthetic. Exaggerated, expressive big eyes. Soft facial lines. Background: Vibrant red with star or colorful confetti elements for decoration. Leave some clean white space around each sticker. Aspect ratio: 9:16
