prompt: |
  Combine multiple images ([Image1], [Image2], [Image3], …) into a single cohesive image. Keep all key subjects recognizable and maintain their proportions and details. Blend the images naturally with consistent lighting, shadows, perspective, and style. Photorealistic, high-resolution, seamless integration.
