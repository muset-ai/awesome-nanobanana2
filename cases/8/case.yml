  35mm film photograph, full shot from behind of an elderly man in a long black overcoat and an elderly woman in a long deep red overcoat, standing symmetrically on a vast concrete tarmac. They are looking at a Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber parked in the middle distance. In the far background are hazy, snow-capped mountains under a pale blue sky. The top third of the image is framed by the interior ceiling of a massive hangar with horizontal beams. Cinematic and formal composition, muted color palette, visible film grain, somber and powerful atmosphere. --ar 2:3 --style raw --v 6.0
