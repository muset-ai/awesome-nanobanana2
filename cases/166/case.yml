prompt: A hyper-realistic cinematic shot of two Formula 1 cars colliding at high speed, captured at the exact moment of impact. Carbon fiber pieces and metal fragments are flying through the air, tires lifting slightly, sparks bursting from the contact point. The cars are still recognizable and not fully destroyed, frozen in mid-crash with dynamic motion blur, intense lighting, dramatic track atmosphere, high-detail realism.
