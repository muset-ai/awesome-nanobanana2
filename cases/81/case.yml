  Create a vertical potrait shot using the exact same face features, characterized by stark cinematic lighting and intense contrast. Captured in a slightly low, upward-facing angle that dramatized the subject’s jawline and neck, the composition evokes quite dominance and sculptural elegance. The background is a deep, saturated crimson red, creating a bold visual clash with the model’s luminous skin and dark wardrobe.
