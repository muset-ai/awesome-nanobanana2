  Take a picture with a Polaroid camera. The photo should look like a normal photo, without any clear subject or props. The photo should have a slight blur a consistent light source. Such as a flash from a dark room, spread throughout the photo. Do not change the faces. Replace the background behind the two people with a white curtain.
