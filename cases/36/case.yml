prompt: |
  Dystopian, arid desert landscape under a hazy orange sky, leading to a distant cyberpunk megalopolis. Central focus: a rusted tech scrap pile with a flickering digital monolith. The monolith displays: "PROMPT OVERLOAD: Reddit silliness consumed creative cycles. Error 404: Imagination Not Found." Holographic snippets of absurd Reddit prompts drift like digital sand. Highly detailed 3D render, volumetric fog, neon reflections.
