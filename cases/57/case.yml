  Replace the background of [Image1] with [desired background description, e.g., a beach, a forest, a city skyline]. Keep the main subject (person/object) unchanged, maintaining original proportions, lighting, and details. Ensure the subject blends naturally with the new environment. Photorealistic, high-resolution, seamless integration.
