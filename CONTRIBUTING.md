## Method 2: Contribute via Pull Request (PR)

1. **Clone the repository and create a local branch.**

2. **Add a New Case:**
* Please refer to our [**case template directory (./case-template/)**](case-template/) to prepare your content. Each case should include two files: a YAML file and an image file.
* Create a new folder under the `cases` directory using the next available numeric ID (e.g., a folder named `83`).  
  **Note:** Just follow the latest number available; the final numbering and ordering will be handled by the maintainer during merging.
* **Prepare the image file:**
    * Image size requirements: recommended width between 300px and 2000px; preferred formats are JPEG, WebP, or PNG; please try to keep the file size under 1MB (compress if necessary).
    * *(Optional)* Filename suggestion: choose a descriptive and unique name for the image (e.g., `gold_pendant_necklace.png`). Default name is `case.png`.
* **Prepare reference images (Optional):**
    * If you used reference images during generation, place them in the same case directory.
    * Suggested naming: `ref_<description>.png`, e.g., `ref_emoji.png`, `ref_style.jpg`.
    * List all reference image filenames in the `reference_images` field in the YAML file.
* **Write the YAML case file:**
    * Fill in or modify the case details according to the template requirements.
    * Make sure to correctly reference your image filename and reference image filenames (if any) in the YAML.
    * Be sure to correctly fill in the following fields:
        * **Author name**
        * **Author link**
        * **Source URL**
    * **Language:** You can provide the information in any language (English, Chinese, etc.). The prompt should be provided in its original language as used for generation.

3. Commit your changes and open a Pull Request on GitHub.

4. Wait for the maintainer to review and merge your PR.
